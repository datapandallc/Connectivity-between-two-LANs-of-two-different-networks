Hey, everyone this is your boy Tunji aka Data Panda. Throughout my networking studies I have had trouble with connecting LANs across different networks.
All of this is done on Packet Tracer.

This lab will be using:
PCs - 6
Switches - 4
Router - 1

In this lab I have decided to use to different topologies to represent the two different LANs: Star Topology & Bus Topology.

First LAN one:
Pick three PCs from the 'end device' section of packet tracer and one switch.
Place them all in the "star Topology" format: 3 pcs coming downward with one switch in front.
With this step you can either choose the cable or the automatic connection choice, but for the sake of learning we will pick the cables.
Connect PC 1 to Fa/0 and connect it to the switch. All of the rest of the PCs will automatically connect to the proper ports but for learning sake:
PC 1 will connect to fa0/1 PC 2 will connect to fa0/2 and PC 2 will connect to fa0/3, respectfully.
Now configure each PC with their own IP address and set a defealt gateway IP. You can set your own but heres my table:
PC 1 - 192.168.1.10 subnet: 255.255.255.0
PC 2 - 192.168.1.11 subnet: 255.255.255.0
PC 3 - 192.168.1.12 subnet: 255.255.255.0
defealt gateway: 192.168.1.13

side benefit: the first three numbers in the IP address makes up the network and the last number is the 'host'
the host has to be different or the network device won't connect.

Ping each PC to test connection within the LAN before moving on to make sure they all are successful.

For now skip the router we wil return to it after creating the second LAN.
Add the remaining four switches and place the last three PCs under each one to create the "bus" topology.
Connect each switch with the copper cross over cable then repeat the steps you did in the first LAN.
This time the IP addresses will be different
PC 1 - 13.12.11.1 subnet: 255.255.255.0
PC 2 - 13.12.11.2 subnet: 255.255.255.0
PC 3 - 13.12.11.3 subnet: 255.255.255.0
defealt gateway: 13.12.11.4

ping within the LAN to confirm connection

Next place your router between both networks and use a copper cable to connect both switch one of LAN 1 with the router and switch two of LAN 2.
Next give the fa0/1 the IPv4 address 192.168.1.13 same as the defealt gateway of LAN 1 and fa0/2 the IPv4 address 13.12.11.4 the same as the defealt gateway for LAN 2.

Ping all the PCs from each PC. Sometime it takes a second for Packet tracer to catch up but all should be connected. 
You should now be able to send an email between both LANs.

Hope this helps!
